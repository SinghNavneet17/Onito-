Make sure the CSV files (movies.csv and ratings.csv) are in a directory accessible from the MySQL CMD.

Load the CSV data into the respective tables using the LOAD DATA INFILE command. Adjust the file paths and table names as needed. For example:

sql command
============
LOAD DATA INFILE 'movies.csv'
INTO TABLE movies
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' ENCLOSED BY '"'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\r\n'
IGNORE 1 ROWS;


sql command
============
LOAD DATA INFILE 'ratings.csv'
INTO TABLE ratings
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' ENCLOSED BY '"'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\r\n'
IGNORE 1 ROWS;


You can query the tables to verify that the data has been successfully imported. For example:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SELECT * FROM movies;
SELECT * FROM ratings;
